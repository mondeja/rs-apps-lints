# leptos_reexports

### What it does

Check for usages of third party libraries re-exports from `leptos`.

### Why is this bad?

Uages of re-exports from `leptos` can lead to dependency duplication,
version conflicts and increase mantaintance burden.

### Known problems

N/A

### Examples

Don't use re-exports from `leptos`:

```rust
use leptos::wasm_bindgen::JsCast;
```

Use instead:

```rust,ignore
use wasm_bindgen::JsCast;
```

Don't use wildcard imports from `leptos`:

```rust
use leptos::*;
```

Use instead:

```rust,ignore
use leptos::html;
```

### Discussion

Hygienic re-exports for third party libraries used by leptos' proc-macros
have been proposed in [leptos#4069].
Currently, is a breaking change that probably is postponed or maybe never
merged because the creator of Leptos feel comfortable about using these
re-exports.
