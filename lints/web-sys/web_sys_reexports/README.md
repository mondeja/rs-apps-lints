# web_sys_reexports

### What it does

Check for usages of third party libraries re-exports from `web-sys`.

### Why is this bad?

Uages of re-exports from `web-sys` can lead to dependency duplication,
version conflicts and increase mantaintance burden.

### Known problems

N/A

### Examples

Don't use re-exports from `web-sys`:

```rust
use web_sys::wasm_bindgen::JsCast;
```

Use instead:

```rust,ignore
use wasm_bindgen::JsCast;
```

Don't use wildcard imports from `web-sys`:

```rust
use web_sys::*;
```

Use instead:

```rust
use web_sys::HtmlElement;
```

### Discussion

`web-sys` reexports the libraries `wasm-bindgen` and `js-sys`.
This behaviour may has sense since `js-sys` and `wasm-bindgen` can be seen
as subsets of the `web-sys` ecosystem. But re-exports because it can lead to
dependency duplication, version conflicts, increase mantaintance burden
and reduce modularity in the codebase.
